                    the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center
                    — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be
                    truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

                    and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.
